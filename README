INSTALLATION

TESTING
When it comes to trying to do TDD on GAE then this blog post:
	http://www.cuberick.com/2008/11/unit-test-your-google-app-engine-models.html
is the best guide I've found so far.

The main thing to takeaway is that you need nose and nose-gae. So...
sudo easy_install nose
sudo easy_install nosegae

Now that you've got the testrunners installed you can run the functional tests:
	nosetests --with-gae streamer_functional_tests.py 

Then you can run the unit tests:
	nosetests --with-gae streamer_tests.py

You can run all the tests by doing:
	nosetests --with-gae streamer_functional_tests.py && nosetests --with-gae streamer_tests.py
