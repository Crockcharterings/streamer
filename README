An aggregator along the lines of Planet but using the Pubsubhubbub protocol for updates 
rather than doing it's own polling or being powered by a cron job.

It's meant to be deployed on Google App Engine and it's written in Python.

INSTALLATION
This isn't yet ready for installation by people who don't feel like changing the Python code. However if you feel brave you should:
- Register an AppEngine application at http://appengine.google.com/start/createapp?
- Change the app.yaml file to have the same Application Identifier as your application.
- Change the APP_NAME constant to have the same Application Identifier as your application.
- Change the SECRET_TOKEN from the default
- Use the Google App Engine Launcher: http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python to deploy the application.


TESTING
When it comes to trying to do TDD on GAE then this blog post:
	http://www.cuberick.com/2008/11/unit-test-your-google-app-engine-models.html
is the best guide I've found so far.

You need gae-testbed, nose and nose-gae. So...
sudo easy_install gaetestbed
sudo easy_install nose
sudo easy_install nosegae
sudo easy_install webtest

Now that you've got the testrunners installed you can run the functional tests:
	nosetests --with-gae streamer_functional_tests.py 

Then you can run the unit tests:
	nosetests --with-gae streamer_tests.py

You can run all the tests by doing:
	nosetests --with-gae streamer_functional_tests.py && nosetests --with-gae streamer_tests.py

You can run individual tests by doing:
    	nosetests --with-gae streamer_tests.py:ContentParserTest.testCanExtractPostsWithExpectedContentFromSampleFeed
