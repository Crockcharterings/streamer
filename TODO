- Each post (identified by a url or id) should only turn up once on the Posts page. 
New entries with the same url/id should replace old ones. Follow the
heuristics I suggested on the feedparser mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/feedparser-dev/msg/29ff575f669bc092 

- Use keys to identify posts. A posts's key should be a tuple
  containing : feed url, post url and (if available) atom:source id

- The handle* function calls should all be made into invocations of deferred.defer()

- Subscriptions should be for 90 days with a scheduled resubscription task being set up to run 30 days in the future. This should ensure that feeds get re-subscribed often enough that changes in hubs will get picked up and ensure that old code doesn't get enqueued.

- List all the things needed to be a valid PSHB subscriber. Consider extracting that out as a reusable interface based on callbacks. Make that into its own configurable library.
- OPML import/export

- Expose an atom feed with support for PSHB and atom:source

- Consider storing the entirety of the feedarser entry
