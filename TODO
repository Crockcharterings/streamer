- Add a(n admin-only) Refresh feature which re-subscribes to every Subscription.
- Add a handler for exporting a textual list of the feeds of the blogs that are being consumed.
- Each post (identified by a url or id) should only turn up once on the Posts page. 
New entries with the same url/id should replace old ones. Follow the
heuristics I suggested on the feedparser mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/feedparser-dev/msg/29ff575f669bc092 

- Use keys to identify posts. A posts's key should be a tuple
  containing : feed url, post url and (if available) atom:source id

- The handle* function calls should all be made into background tasks by putting them into task queues.

- List all the things needed to be a valid PSHB subscriber. Consider extracting that out as a reusable interface based on callbacks. Make that into its own configurable library.
- OPML import/export

- Expose an atom feed with support for PSHB and atom:source

- Store the entirety of the feedarser entry and expose all of it in the Atom feed that's generated. We should support MustIgnore by making sure that anything that comes in to Streamer goes out.
